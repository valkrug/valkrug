This is my solutions for the problems published on study platform Stepic.org

# Problem 1. 
# Write a function <find_outliers> that receives as an input a dataframe with one quantitative variable and any number of factor variables. 
# Factor variables will break all our observations into a certain number of groups.
# You should create a new numeric variable <is_outlier> in the data, which should be 1 if the observation in this row is an outlier in its group, and 0 if it is not.

# SOLUTION
> librury(dplyr)
> find_outliers <- function(t){
>   t$name <- t[,sapply(t, is.numeric)]
>   t %>% 
>     group_by_if(is.factor) %>%
>     mutate(name, is_outlier= ifelse(name > mean(name)+2*sd(name) | name < mean(name)-2*sd(name), 1, 0)) %>% 
>     select(!name)
> }

# Problem 2. 
# We have a data set (.csv) with errors. My task was to write the fix_data function, which receives a dataset as an input. Some variables of the data set have space between numbers added in some
# of the numeric variables. We need to delete this space and return the numeric variables to their numeric type (because now they are string). The function should return a converted
# dataset, in which all numeric variables will be converted to a numeric type, while those variables that really string do not need to be
# converted in any way.

# SOLUTION
> librury(dplyr)
> library(stringi)
> fix_data <- function(d){
>   var_names <- names(d) 
>   fixed_data <- mutate_at(d, var_names, .funs = function(x) ifelse(stri_detect_regex(x, "[[:alpha:]]")==FALSE, 
> as.numeric(stri_replace_all(x, regex = "[[:space:]]", "")), x))
> }
