This is my solutions for the problems punlished on study platform Stepic.org

Problem 1. 
Write a function <find_outliers> that receives as an input a dataframe with one quantitative variable and any number of factor variables. 
Factor variables will break all our observations into a certain number of groups.
You should create a new numeric variable <is_outlier> in the data, which should be 1 if the observation in this row is an outlier in its group, and 0 if it is not.

SOLUTION
> librury(dplyr)
> find_outliers <- function(t){
>   t$name <- t[,sapply(t, is.numeric)]
>   t %>% 
>     group_by_if(is.factor) %>%
>     mutate(name, is_outlier= ifelse(name > mean(name)+2*sd(name) | name < mean(name)-2*sd(name), 1, 0)) %>% 
>     select(!name)
> }
